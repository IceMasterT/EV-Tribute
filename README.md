EV-Tribute is a multiplayer top-down space adventure game in the tradition of Escape Velocity.


To run it you need python, pyglet, and rabbyt. To run the mapmaker.py utility you also need PMW (python megawidgets).

To "play" the game you must first start the server.py, then the worldcommander.py and finally the game.py.


The networking stuff is handled thanks to the brilliant "Mastermind Networking Lib" by Ian Mallet.

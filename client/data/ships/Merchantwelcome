				Merchant Welcome Letter	



	Look, you work for me now. I house you and that piece of junk you call a ship so you're gonna listen to what I have to say. First off no wreckless behaviour, if you want that go join the Resistance. Those damned fools are gonna get themselves killed off very fast the way they wage war. Secondly, No killing. I dont care how angry you get if you kill or even harm one of my men then I will destroy you. If its blood you're after then go join the Federation. They kill more people then my stunning good looks. Last but not least, get out there, sell some stuff, and make some money! Good luck boy.

				Federation Welcome Letter	



	The Year is... Unimportant. Who I am... Is Unimportant. What you are about to read... Is Unimportant. 
	The journey you are about to embark on is the ONLY thing that matters now. 
	Throughout the history of our race we have fallen and risen many times and 
	despite all who wish to destroy us we live on. Now Humanity has finally reached its peak and 
	has within its grasp the ability to destroy its enemys and claim what is rightfully ours. 
	Tribe must be ours. I leave it up to you to unite all the Human Races and destroy all who stand in our way. 
	Good luck soldier.

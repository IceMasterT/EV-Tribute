			Resistance Welcome Letter	



These are difficult times. Our race has reached a new extreme level of corruption and disorder and I fear the rebellian may be to late to stop it. Its up to you and the recruits like you to save whats left of our humanity. Take it and run. Ally yourselves with any friendly factions and help defend them as we should hope they will defend us and above all, secure the on going existance of our race. Good luck Brother.

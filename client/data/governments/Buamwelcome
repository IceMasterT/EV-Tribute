				Buan Welcome Letter



	They call us maggots, they call us slime, they call us worms. 
	They call us puke, they call us waste, but you... you may call us Buan. 
	We are a highly organized group more advanced then the Humans or the Hellians will ever be. 
	We have no names, and our only purpose for life is to undo the harm that the 
	Humans and Hellians have brought to Tribe. We shall undo that which they have done at all costs, 
	even if it means the extinction of their races. Keep this in mind, for you are now a servant of Buan.

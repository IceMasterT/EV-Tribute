				Pirate Welcome Letter



	So you think you're tough now, huh? So what, you killed a few people? You got yourself a bit of a rep going on? 
	Let me tell you what you are, you're nothing. You're nothing but fly on my ass and the second you start to bother me 
	Im gonna slap you so hard you wont be able to eat for a week. So yes, you're granted safety at my ports, and 
	yes our intel will be available to you. But you... You better watch yourself out there...

				Hellian Welcome Letter	



	For generations we've waited in the dark. All we did was seek their friendship and instead we found slavery. But now we are free. Now we can finally rise up again. With the Federations main forces focused on the Resistance of UT we have a perfect chance to strike. However, time is not on our side. We must rise up and destroy them. Destroy them all!
